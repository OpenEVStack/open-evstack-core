# OpenEVStack Core

OpenEVStack Core is the backend foundation of the OpenEVStack platform, designed to power Electric Vehicle (EV) management and simulation tools. It is an open-source backend that aims to fill the gaps in existing EV platforms by providing features like an open-source EV simulator, CSMS (Central System Management Software), and seamless integration with EV charging infrastructure.

## Features

- **Central System Management**: Manage EV charging stations, monitor charging sessions, and track EV data.
- **Protocol Integration**: Supports common EV charging protocols such as OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol).
- **Simulation**: Simulate EV charging scenarios to test and optimize EV infrastructure.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle a large number of connected EV chargers and users.
- **Open-Source**: Contribute to the project and help build a more sustainable and efficient EV ecosystem.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: The core of the backend is built using Node.js for scalability and performance.
- **Express**: RESTful APIs for easy communication between the backend and frontend.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing EV data and charging sessions.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and real-time communication.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application for easy deployment.
